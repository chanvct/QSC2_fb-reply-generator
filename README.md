Description:

This virtual assistant aims to help LTA officers draft a reply to a feedback/query sent in by the public.

It runs on OpenAI's GPT-3.5-Turbo model and has ingested information from the following sources: 
1.LTA.gov.sg
2. MOT's parlimentary queries (Jan 2020 - Apr 2023)
3. AskJamie (sample of 500)
4. EFMS (sample of 100)

It will search the ingested information and use it in the reply *if relevant. (Cited sources may turn out irrelevant due to lack of related content from LTA's website)

The LTA officer can also input comments to influence the reply based on the next steps, actions to be taken, decisions made, considerations etc.
